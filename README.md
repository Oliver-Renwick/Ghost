# Ghost Engine

Ghost is a custom game engine built from scratch using C++ and Vulkan. It supports multithreaded draw submission, asynchronous asset streaming, and utilizes a frame graph system for efficient render pass management. The engine also features a custom UDP-based multiplayer networking layer and an impulse-based physics simulation system.
